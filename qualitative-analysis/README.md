## Introduction
This folder contains qualitative responses from participants and corresponding codes we assign to those responses. We also include a list of all the codes we used during the qualitative coding.

* `2022-ACSAC-Five-Word-Password-Codebook.pdf`: List of all codes used to encode participants' answer to free-response questions.
* `Pre-Survey Qualitative Responses.xlsx`: All answers participants gave for free-response questions in the pre-survey. For each question, there are three sheets, one for the primary coder, one for the secondary coder and a third containing all the codes used for that question.
* `Post-Survey Qualitative Responses.xlsx`: All answers participants gave for free-response questions in the post-survey. For each question, there are three sheets, one for the primary coder, one for the secondary coder and a third containing all the codes used for that question.
